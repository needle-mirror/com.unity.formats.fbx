# FBX Recorder

With the FBX Exporter and the [Unity Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@2.1/index.html), it is possible to export animations (including [Cinemachine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.3/manual/index.html) camera animations) directly to FBX in a few easy steps:

1. Open the Recorder window by selecting (Window > General > Recorder > Recorder Window)
2. In the Recorder window add a new FBX recorder

3. Set the GameObject to record as well as any other desired settings
4. Click "Start Recording" in the Recorder Window

Alternatively, the FBX Recorder can be added as a track in the Timeline.
